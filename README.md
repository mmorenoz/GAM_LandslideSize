##  Modeling the area of co-seismic landslides via data-driven models: the Kaikōura example
This is the R code to reproduce the analysis in " Modeling the size of co-seismic landslides via data-driven models: the Kaikōura's example" by Mateo Moreno, Stefan Steger, Hakan Tanyas and Luigi Lombardo.

The provided script runs the landslide size modeling using GAMS, its respective validation via random cross-validation and spatial cross-validation, as well as the visualization of the results.
